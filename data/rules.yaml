    of an authorised central counterparty acknowledgement letter (and

    4), to the relevant authorised central counterparty.

    7.18.2 R (2) and CASS 7.18.3 R (3), firms are required to have in place a

    countersigned acknowledgment letter for a client bank account or client

    (respectively) before they are allowed to hold or receive client money in

    bank account, or allow the relevant person to hold any client money on the

    account (respectively).

    firm may place client money at an authorised central counterparty in

    a regulated clearing arrangement if it has provided the relevant authorised

    with a signed and completed authorised central counterparty

    letter (see CASS 7.8.3 R).

    of relevant accounts

    that for each client bank account or client transaction account it needs

    an acknowledgement letter. Accordingly, it is important that it is clear to

    accounts each acknowledgement letter relates. As a result, the templates

    2, CASS 7 Annex 3 and CASS 7 Annex 4 require that the

    letter include the full title and at least one unique identifier, such as a sort

    CASS

    number, deposit number, reference code or pool ID, for each client bank

    transaction account to which the letter relates.

    identifiers included in an acknowledgement letter for a client bank

    transaction account should be the same as those reflected in both the

    and the relevant counterparty, as appropriate, for that account. Where a

    are not able to reflect the full title of an account, that title may be

    that system, provided that:

    may continue to be appropriately identified in accordance with the

    of CASS 7 (eg, ''designated'' may be shortened to ''des'', ''designated fund''

    to ''des fnd'', ''segregated'' may be shortened to ''seg'', ''account'' may be

    ''acct'', etc); and

    an acknowledgement letter, such letter must include both the long

    of the account title.

    ensure that all relevant account information is contained in the space

    body of the acknowledgement letter. Nothing should be appended to an

    letter.

    provided in the template letters for setting out the account title and unique

    relevant account/deposit, a firm may include the required information in

    following table:
