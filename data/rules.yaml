    for client s'' assets when the firm is responsible for them. An essential part

    rules in CASS 5.1 to CASS 5.6 also give effect to the requirement in article 10.6
    of the IDD that all necessary measures should be taken to protect clients against
    the inability of an insurance intermediary to transfer premiums to an insurance
    undertaking or to transfer the proceeds of a claim or premium refund to the insured.


    (2) There are two particular approaches which firms can adopt which reflect options
    given in article 10.6. The first is to provide by law or contract for a transfer
    of risk from the insurance intermediary to the insurance undertaking ( CASS 5.2
    ). The second is that client money is strictly segregated by being transferred
    to client accounts that cannot be used to reimburse other creditors in the event
    of the firm''s insolvency ( CASS 5.3 and CASS 5.4 provide different means of achieving
    such segregation). CASS 5.1.5A R permits a firm subject to certain conditions
    to treat money which it collects as agent of an insurance undertaking as client
    money ; the principle of strict segregation is, however, satisfied because such
    undertakings must agree to their interests being subordinated to the interests

    and in the form set out in CASS 7 Annex 2 (Client bank account acknowledgment

    template, a firm is reminded that it must not amend any of the text which is not
    in square brackets ( acknowledgment letter fixed text ). A firm should also not
    amend the non-italicised text that is in square brackets. It may remove or include
    square bracketed text from the letter, or replace bracketed and italicised text
    with the necessary wording, in either case as appropriate. The notes below give
    further guidance on this. 7 A firm is reminded that for each client bank account
    or client transaction account it needs to have in place an acknowledgement letter
    . Accordingly, it is important that it is clear to which account or accounts each
    acknowledgement letter relates. As a result, the templates in CASS 7 Annex 2 ,
    CASS 7 Annex 3 and CASS 7 Annex 4 require that the acknowledgement letter include

  text: '2. Under CASS 11.8.2 R (2) , CASS debt management firms are required to have
    in place a duly signed and countersigned client bank account acknowledgement letter
    for a client bank account before they are allowed to hold or receive client money
    in or into the account. 2. 3. For each client bank account a CASS debt management
    firm is required to complete, sign and send to the approved bank a client bank
    account acknowledgement letter identifying that account and in the form set out
    in CASS 11 Annex 1 (CASS debt management firm client bank account acknowledgment
    letter template). 3. 4 . When completing a client bank account acknowledgement
    letter using the appropriate template, a CASS debt management firm is reminded
    that it must not amend any of the text which is not in square brackets (acknowledgment
    letter fixed text). A CASS debt management firm should also not amend the non-italicised
    text that is in square brackets. It may remove or include square bracketed text
    from the letter, or replace bracketed and italicised text with the required information,
    in either case as appropriate. The notes below give further guidance on this.
    1. 5. A CASS debt management firm is reminded that for each client bank account
    it needs to have in place a client bank account acknowledgement letter . As a
    result, it is important that it is clear to which account or accounts each client
    bank account acknowledgement letter relates. As a result, the templates in CASS
    11 Annex 1 require that the client bank account acknowledgement letter include
    the full title and at least one unique identifier, such as a sort code and account
    number, deposit number or reference code, for each client bank account . 2. 6.
    The title and unique identifiers included in a client bank account acknowledgement
    letter for a client bank account should be the same as those reflected in both
    the records of the CASS debt management firm and the relevant approved bank ,
    as appropriate, for that account. Where an approved bank''s systems are not able
    to reflect the full title of an account, that title may be abbreviated to accommodate
    that system, provided that:


    1.


    (a) the account may continue to be appropriately identified in line with the requirements
    of CASS 11 (for example, ‘segregated’ may be shortened to ‘seg’, ‘account’ may
    be shortened to ‘acct’ etc); and CASS approved bank ] systems CASS CASS'

    does not provide the CASS debt management firm with sufficient evidence of his/her
    authority to do so then the CASS debt management firm is expected to make appropriate
    enquiries to satisfy itself of that individual’s authority. 3. 21. Evidence of
    an individual’s authority to countersign a client bank account acknowledgement
    letter may include a copy of the approved bank's list of authorised signatories,
    a duly executed power of attorney, use of a company seal or bank stamp, and/or

    client bank account acknowledgement letter . 4. 22. A CASS debt management firm
    should ensure it obtains at least the same level of assurance over the authority
    of an individual to countersign the client bank account acknowledgement letter
    as the firm would seek when managing its own commercial arrangements. 1. 23. If
    a CASS debt management firm uses a third party administrator (TPA) to carry out
    the administrative tasks of drafting, sending and processing a client bank account
    acknowledgement letter , the text "[Signed by [ Name of Third Party Administrator
    ] on behalf of [ CASS debt management firm ]]" should be inserted to confirm that
    the client bank account acknowledgement letter was signed by the TPA on behalf
    of the CASS debt management firm . 2. CASS CASS CASS
