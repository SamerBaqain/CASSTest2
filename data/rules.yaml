    (1A) There are three elements of the regime for SMCR firms that are particularly
    relevant to

    CASS 1A, although they do not all apply to all SMCR firms:

    (a) a firm’s obligation to allocate certain responsibilities to its SMF managers
    (see SYSC

    24 (Senior managers and certification regime: Allocation of prescribed responsibilities));

    (b) a firm’s obligation to ensure that one or more of its SMF managers have overall

    responsibility for each of its activities, business areas and management functions
    (see

    SYSC 26 (Senior managers and certification regime: Overall and local responsibility));

    and

    (c) the certification regime (the certification regime is explained in SYSC 27
    (Senior

    managers and certification regime: Certification regime) and SYSC TP 7 (Bank of

    England and Financial Services Act 2016: Certification and regulatory references)

    CASS 1A CASS firm classification and operational

    oversight

    CASS

    explains that the certification regime comes into force sometime after other parts
    of the

    senior managers and certification regime).

    (2)

    (a) This paragraph (2) explains how CASS 1A.3.1AR applies to an SMCR firm to which

    SYSC 24 and SYSC 26 both apply.

    (b) The firm must allocate responsibility for the firm’s compliance with CASS
    to one of its

    SMF managers (see SYSC 24.2.1R). That responsibility is an “FCA-prescribed senior

    management responsibility”. The full list of FCA-prescribed senior management

    responsibilities is in the table in SYSC 24.2.6R.

    (c) Although the CASS function in SYSC 24.2.1R is different from the function
    in CASS

    1A.3.1AR, the firm may allocate the function in CASS 1A.3.1AR to the SMF manager
    in

    (b).

    (d) The firm may allocate the CASS FCA-prescribed senior management responsibility

    described in (b) to an SMF manager who does not perform any other function coming

    within the FCA regime for SMF managers in SMCR firms. See SUP 10C.7 (Other overall

    responsibility function (SMF18)) and SUP 10C.8.1R (Other local responsibility
    function

    (SMF22)) for details. Where this is the case, the manager will be performing the
    other

    overall responsibility function or the other local responsibility function.

    (e) The firm may choose to allocate the function in CASS 1A.3.1AR to someone who
    is

    not an approved person and SMF manager. If so:

    (i) that person will be subject to the employee certification regime described
    in SYSC

    27 (Senior managers and certification regime: (Certification Regime);

    (ii) that person will be subject to supervision by the SMF manager in (b); and

    (iii) the function in CASS 1A.3.1AR will be the CASS oversight FCA certification

    function in SYSC 27.8.1R.

    (3) In relation to an SMCR firm to which SYSC 24 applies but SYSC 26 does not
    apply, the

    guidance in sub-paragraphs (2)(b), (2)(c), and 2(e) applies, but the guidance
    in subparagraph (2)(d) does not apply.

    (4)

    (a) The position of an SMCR firm to which neither SYSC 24 nor SYSC 26 apply is

    slightly different.

    (b) The firm may choose to allocate the function in CASS 1A.3.1AR to an SMF manager.

    (c) The firm may instead choose to allocate the function in CASS 1A.3.1AR to someone

    who is not an SMF manager.

    (d) Where (c) applies, the person performing the function in CASS 1A.3.1AR will
    fall into

    the certification regime. The function in CASS 1A.3.1AR will be the CASS oversight
    FCA

    certification function in SYSC 27.8.1R.'

    is the

    proper accounting and handling of client money. The rules in CASS 5.1 to CASS

    (2) There are two particular approaches which firms can adopt which reflect options
    given in

    article 10.6. The first is to provide by law or contract for a transfer of risk
    from the insurance

    intermediary to the insurance undertaking (CASS 5.2). The second is that client
    money is

    strictly segregated by being transferred to client accounts that cannot be used
    to reimburse

    other creditors in the event of the firm''s insolvency (CASS 5.3 and CASS 5.4
    provide

    different means of achieving such segregation). CASS 5.1.5A R permits a firm subject
    to

    certain conditions to treat money which it collects as agent of an insurance undertaking
    as

    client money; the principle of strict segregation is, however, satisfied because

    Alternatively, an agency agreement may confer on the intermediary contractual
    authority to

  text: '(1) This rule applies where a firm identifies a discrepancy as a result of,
    or that reveals, a

    shortfall, which the firm has not yet resolved.

    (2) Subject to paragraphs (3) and (4), until the discrepancy is resolved a firm
    must do one of

    the following:

    (a) appropriate a sufficient number of its own applicable assets to cover the
    value of the

    shortfall and hold them for the relevant clients under the custody rules in such
    a way that

    the applicable assets, or the proceeds of their liquidation, will be available
    for distribution

    for the benefit of the relevant clients in the event of the firm''s failure and,
    in doing so:

    (i) ensure that the applicable assets are clearly identifiable as separate from
    the

    firm''s own property and are recorded by the firm in its client-specific safe
    custody

    asset record as being held for the relevant client;

    (ii) keep a record of the actions the firm has taken under this rule which includes
    a

    description of the shortfall, identifies the relevant affected clients, and lists
    the

    applicable assets that the firm has appropriated to cover the shortfall; and

    (iii) update the record made under (ii) whenever the discrepancy is resolved and
    the

    firm has re-appropriated the applicable assets; or

    (b) (provided that doing so is consistent with the firm''s permissions and would
    result in

    money being held for the relevant client) in respect of the shortfall under CASS
    7.17.2 R

    (statutory trust) appropriate a sufficient amount of its own money to cover the
    value of

    the shortfall, hold it for the relevant client as client money under the client
    money rules

    and, in doing so:

    (i) ensure the money is segregated under CASS 7.13 (Segregation of client money)

    and recorded as being held for the relevant client under CASS 7.15 (Records,

    accounts and reconciliations);

    (ii) keep a record of the actions the firm has taken under this rule which includes
    a

    description of the shortfall, identifies the relevant affected clients, and specifies
    the

    amount of money that the firm has appropriated to cover the shortfall; and

    CASS 6 Custody rules www.handbook.fca.org.uk September 2025

    CASS

    (iii) update the record made under (ii) whenever the discrepancy is resolved and
    the

    firm has re-appropriated the money; or

    (c) appropriate a number of applicable assets in accordance with (a) and an amount
    of

    money in accordance with (b) which, in aggregate, are sufficient to cover the
    value of the

    shortfall.

    (3) If the firm, where justified, concludes that another person is responsible
    for the

    discrepancy, regardless of any dispute with that other person, or that the discrepancy
    is due

    to a timing difference between the accounting systems of that other person and
    that of the

    firm, the firm must take all reasonable steps to resolve the situation without
    undue delay

    with the other person. Until the discrepancy is resolved the firm must consider
    whether it

    would be appropriate to notify the affected client of the situation, and may take
    steps under

    (2) for the treatment of shortfalls until that discrepancy is resolved.

    (4) A firm that has failed is not required to take steps under paragraph (2) in
    relation to the

    firm’s own applicable assets or money in so far as the legal procedure for the
    firm’s failure

    prevents the firm from taking any such steps.'

    (2) The amount required to be segregated under this rule must be an amount that
    a firm

    reasonably determines would be sufficient, at the time it makes the determination,
    to protect

    client money against the risk that at any time in the following three months the
    following

    categories of client money may not have been fully segregated in its client bank
    account or

    may not be (or become) available for pooling under CASS 7A.2.4R (1), were a primary

    pooling event to occur:

    (a) client money that is received and held by the firm in its own bank account
    during the

    period between:

    (i) the firm''s adjustment of client bank account balances under CASS 7.13.62
    R (3)

    on a particular business day; and

    (ii) the firm''s subsequent adjustments under CASS 7.13.62 R (3) on the following

    business day; and

    (b) money received and held by the firm in its own bank account which the firm
    does not

    initially identify as part of its client money requirement, but which subsequently
    does

    become part of its client money requirement;

    with the effect that the firm''s alternative approach mandatory prudent segregation
    under this

    rule will reduce, as far as possible, any shortfall that might have been produced
    as a result

    of (a) or (b) on the occurrence of a primary pooling event.

    (3)

    (a) Subject to (c), in reaching its determination under (2) of the amount of money
    that

    would be sufficient to address the risks referred to in (2) for the forthcoming
    three

    months, a firm must take into account the following in respect of each business
    line for

    which it uses the alternative approach, and for at least the previous three months:

    (i) the firm''s client money requirement over the course of that prior period
    (excluding

    any amount that was required to be segregated under this rule during that prior

    period for the purposes of alternative approach mandatory prudent segregation);

    (ii) the daily adjustment payments that the firm made into its client bank account

    under CASS 7.13.62 R (3) during that prior period; and

    (iii) the amount of money received by the firm in its own bank account which it
    did not

    initially identify as part of its client money requirement, but which subsequently,
    and

    during that prior period, became part of its client money requirement;

    as shown in its internal records.

    (b) In reaching its determination under (2) a firm must also take into account,
    but at all

    times having regard to the requirement under (2), any impact that particular events,
    the

    seasonal nature of each relevant business line, or any other aspect of those business

    lines may have on:

    (i) the firm''s client money requirement during the forthcoming three months for
    which

    the amount of alternative approach mandatory prudent segregation required under

    this rule is being determined;

    (ii) the daily adjustment payments that the firm is likely to make into its client
    bank

    account under CASS 7.13.62 R (3) in that same period; and

    (iii) the amount of unidentified receipts of money that the firm is likely to
    receive into

    its own bank account and which will subsequently, in that same period, become
    part

    of its client money requirement.

    (c) If, at the time of its determination under (2), the firm has not been trading
    for three

    months in a business line for which it is using the alternative approach, then
    it must use

    the records that are available to it and must also factor in reasonable forecasts,
    as

    required under (b), to establish a three-month reference period.

    (4)

    (a) A firm must, at regular intervals that are at least quarterly, repeat and
    complete the

    combined process of:

    (i) determining the amount that it is required to segregate for the purposes of

    alternative approach mandatory prudent segregation under (2) and (3);

    (ii) making necessary adjustments to its records to reflect any changes to its
    client

    money requirement (in accordance with CASS 7.16.16 R (3) and CASS 7.16.17 R

    (2)); and

    (iii) paying any additional amounts of its own money into its client bank account
    to

    increase the firm''s alternative approach mandatory prudent segregation or

    withdrawing any excess amounts from its client bank account to decrease the firm''s

    alternative approach mandatory prudent segregation after it has adjusted its records

    under (ii).

    (b) The combined process of (a)(i) to (iii) must take no longer than ten business
    days.

    (c) To the extent that a firm''s compliance with (a)(i) and (ii) results in there
    being an

    excess in the firm''s client bank account, the firm may cease to treat that money
    as client

    money.

    (5) A firm must ensure that the individual responsible for CASS oversight under

    of

    (2) A firm that is also a clearing member of an authorised central counterparty
    may wish to

    segregate client money specifically for the benefit of a group of clients who
    have chosen to

    clear positions through a net margined omnibus client account maintained by the
    firm with

    that authorised central counterparty, where that segregation might facilitate
    the porting of

    client positions recorded in that net margined omnibus client account. To segregate
    client

    money (that would otherwise be held in the general pool) for a specific group
    of clients

    clearing positions through a particular net margined omnibus client account, a
    clearing

    member firm may, in accordance with these rules, create a sub-pool of client money.

    (3) Upon the occurrence of a primary pooling event, the client money for:

    (a) the general pool, should be distributed in accordance with CASS 7A to the
    clients for

    whom the firm receives or holds client money in that general pool; and

    (b) a sub-pool, should either be:

    (i) transferred to facilitate porting; or

    (ii) distributed to the clients who are beneficiaries of that sub-pool, according
    to their

    respective interests under CASS 7A.2.4R (2)(a).

    (4) All client money is received or held by the firm as trustee for the clients
    of the firm.

    However, a clearing member of an authorised central counterparty who clears client

    positions through a net margined omnibus client account may organise its affairs
    (with the

    consent of the relevant clients) in such a way that those clients need not share
    in the

    general pool of client money following a primary pooling event, save to the extent

    CASS

    Section : CASS 7 Annex 5 Guidance notes for acknowledgement letters (CASS 7.18)

    CASS 7 Annex 5 Introduction

    G 1 This annex contains guidance on the use of the templates for acknowledgement
    letters in

    CASS 7 Annex 2, CASS 7 Annex 3 and CASS 7 Annex 4.

    2 Unless stated otherwise, a reference to ''counterparty'' in this annex is:

    1.

    (a) in the context of a client bank account acknowledgement letter (and CASS 7
    Annex

    2), to the relevant bank;

    (b) in the context of a client transaction account acknowledgement letter (and
    CASS 7

    Annex 3), to the relevant exchange, clearing house, intermediate broker, OTC

    counterparty or other person (as the case may be); and

    (c) in the context of an authorised central counterparty acknowledgement letter
    (and

    CASS 7 Annex 4), to the relevant authorised central counterparty.

    General

    1. 3 Under CASS 7.18.2 R (2) and CASS 7.18.3 R (3), firms are required to have
    in place a

    duly signed and countersigned acknowledgment letter for a client bank account
    or client

    transaction account (respectively) before they are allowed to hold or receive
    client money in

    or into the client bank account, or allow the relevant person to hold any client
    money on the

    client transaction account (respectively).

    2. 4 However, a firm may place client money at an authorised central counterparty
    in

    connection with a regulated clearing arrangement if it has provided the relevant
    authorised

    central counterparty with a signed and completed authorised central counterparty

    acknowledgement letter (see CASS 7.8.3 R).

    3. 5 For each client bank account or client transaction account, a firm is required
    to

    complete, sign and send to the counterparty an acknowledgment letter identifying
    that

    account and in the form set out in CASS 7 Annex 2 (Client bank account acknowledgment

    letter template), CASS 7 Annex 3 (Client transaction account acknowledgment letter

    template) or CASS 7 Annex 4 (Authorised central counterparty acknowledgment letter),
    as

    appropriate.

    4. 6 When completing an acknowledgment letter using the appropriate template,
    a firm is

    reminded that it must not amend any of the text which is not in square brackets

    (acknowledgment letter fixed text). A firm should also not amend the non-italicised
    text that

    is in square brackets. It may remove or include square bracketed text from the
    letter, or

    replace bracketed and italicised text with the necessary wording, in either case
    as

    appropriate. The notes below give further guidance on this.

    Clear identification of relevant accounts

    7 A firm is reminded that for each client bank account or client transaction account
    it needs

    to have in place an acknowledgement letter. Accordingly, it is important that
    it is clear to

    which account or accounts each acknowledgement letter relates. As a result, the
    templates

    in CASS 7 Annex 2, CASS 7 Annex 3 and CASS 7 Annex 4 require that the

    acknowledgement letter include the full title and at least one unique identifier,
    such as a sort

    CASS 7 Client money rules www.handbook.fca.org.uk September 2025

    CASS

    code and account number, deposit number, reference code or pool ID, for each client
    bank

    account or client transaction account to which the letter relates.

    8 The title and unique identifiers included in an acknowledgement letter for a
    client bank

    account or client transaction account should be the same as those reflected in
    both the

    records of the firm and the relevant counterparty, as appropriate, for that account.
    Where a

    counterparty''s systems are not able to reflect the full title of an account,
    that title may be

    abbreviated to accommodate that system, provided that:

    1.

    (a) the account may continue to be appropriately identified in accordance with
    the

    requirements of CASS 7 (eg, ''designated'' may be shortened to ''des'', ''designated
    fund''

    may be shortened to ''des fnd'', ''segregated'' may be shortened to ''seg'', ''account''
    may be

    shortened to ''acct'', etc); and

    (b) when completing an acknowledgement letter, such letter must include both the
    long

    and short versions of the account title.

    9 A firm should ensure that all relevant account information is contained in the
    space

    provided in the body of the acknowledgement letter. Nothing should be appended
    to an

    acknowledgement letter.

    10 In the space provided in the template letters for setting out the account title
    and unique

    identifiers for each relevant account/deposit, a firm may include the required
    information in

    the format of the following table:

    Full account title Unique identifier Title reflected in [name of

    bank] systems

    [Investment Firm Client [00-00-00 12345678] [INV FIRM CLIENT A/C]

    Bank Account]

    11 Where an acknowledgement letter is intended to cover a range of client bank
    accounts or

    client transaction accounts, some of which may not exist as at the date the

    acknowledgement letter is countersigned by the relevant person (or, in the case
    of an

    authorised central counterparty acknowledgement letter, the date it is sent by
    the firm to the

    relevant authorised central counterparty), a firm should set out in the space
    provided in the

    body of the acknowledgement letter that it is intended to apply to all present
    and future

    accounts which: (a) are titled in a specified way (eg, with the word ''client''
    in their title); and

    (b) which possess a common unique identifier or which may be clearly identified
    by a range

    of unique identifiers (eg, all accounts numbered between XXXX1111 and ZZZZ9999).
    For

    example, in the space provided in the template letter in CASS 7 Annex 2 which
    allows a firm

    to include the account title and a unique identifier for each relevant account,
    a firm should

    include a statement to the following effect:

    1.

    CASS 7 Client money rules www.handbook.fca.org.uk September 2025

    CASS

    Any account open at present or to be opened in the future which contains the term

    [''client''][insert appropriate abbreviation of the term ''client'' as agreed
    and to be

    reflected in the Bank''s systems] in its title and which may be identified with
    [the

    following [insert common unique identifier]][an account number from and

    including [XXXX1111] to and including [ZZZZ9999]][clearly identify range of

    unique identifiers].

    Signature and countersignatures

    1. 12 A firm should ensure that each acknowledgement letter is signed and countersigned

    by all relevant parties and individuals (including where a firm or its counterparty
    may require

    more than one signatory).

    2. 13 An acknowledgement letter that is signed or countersigned electronically
    should not,

    for that reason alone, result in a breach of the rules in CASS 7.19 . However,
    where

    electronic signatures are used, a firm should consider whether, under CASS 7.13.8
    R and

    taking into account the governing law and choice of competent jurisdiction, it
    needs to

    ensure that the electronic signature and the certification by any person of such
    signature

    would be admissible as evidence in any legal proceedings in the relevant jurisdiction
    in

    relation to any question as to the authenticity or integrity of the letter.

    Completing an acknowledgment letter

    14 A firm should use at least the same level of care and diligence when completing
    an

    acknowledgement letter as it would in managing its own commercial agreements.

    15 A firm should ensure that each acknowledgement letter is legible (eg, any handwritten

    details should be easy to read), produced on the firm''s own letter-headed paper,
    dated and

    addressed to the correct legal entity (eg, where the counterparty belongs to a
    group of

    companies).

    16 A firm should also ensure each acknowledgement letter includes all the required

    information (such as account names and numbers, the parties'' full names, addresses
    and

    contact information, and each signatory''s printed name and title).

    17 A firm should similarly ensure that no square brackets remain in the text of
    each

    acknowledgement letter (ie, after having removed or included square bracketed
    text, as

    appropriate, or having replaced square bracketed and italicised text with the
    required

    information as indicated in the templates in CASS 7 Annex 2, CASS 7 Annex 3 and
    CASS 7

    Annex 4) and that each page of the acknowledgement letter is numbered.

    18 A firm should complete an acknowledgement letter so that no part of the letter
    can be

    easily altered (eg, the letter should be signed in ink rather than pencil).

    19 In respect of a client bank account acknowledgement letter''s governing law
    and choice of

    competent jurisdiction (see paragraphs (l) and (m) of the template in CASS 7 Annex
    2R) or

    a client transaction account acknowledgement letter''s governing law and choice
    of

    competent jurisdiction (see paragraphs (k) and (l) of the template in CASS 7 Annex
    3 R), the

    letter should reflect a firm''s agreement with its counterparty that the laws
    of a particular

    jurisdiction will govern the acknowledgement letter and that the courts of that
    same

    jurisdiction will have non-exclusive jurisdiction to settle any disputes arising
    out of, or in

    connection with, the acknowledgement letter, its subject matter or formation.

    20 If a firm does not, in any client bank account acknowledgement letter or client
    transaction

    CASS 7 Client money rules www.handbook.fca.org.uk September 2025

    CASS

    account acknowledgement letter, utilise the governing law and choice of competent

    jurisdiction that is the same as either or both:

    1.

    (a) the law and the jurisdiction under which either the firm or the relevant counterparty

    are organised; and

    (b) that specified in the underlying agreement/s (eg, banking, custody or clearing

    services agreement) with the relevant counterparty;

    then the firm should consider whether it is at risk of breaching either CASS 7.18.6
    R (3) or,

    in the case of a client bank account acknowledgement letter, CASS 7.13.8 R .

    21 The FCA recognises that some firms and their counterparties may wish to clarify
    through

    additional words in the governing law provision (see paragraph (l) of the template
    in CASS 7

    Annex 2 and paragraph (k) of the template in CASS 7 Annex 3) that they are agreeing
    that

    the substantive law of the governing jurisdiction shall apply and that their intention
    is that a

    court should not decide to apply the substantive provisions of some other law
    instead of the

    parties'' chosen governing law (a ''renvoi''). Where this is the case firms are
    permitted to

    insert additional text that seeks to provide increased legal certainty in the
    space provided.

    There is no restriction as to what additional words may be used (eg, additional
    words such

    as "without regard to the principles of choice of law" may be appropriate in the

    circumstances), but a firm should at all times have regard to the need to comply
    with CASS

    7.18.6 R (3) . However, for the majority of firms the FCA does not expect additional
    wording

    for the governing law provision to be necessary. This is likely to be the case
    where only a

    court that is subject to ''Rome I'' (Regulation (EC) No 593/2008 of the European
    Parliament

    and of the Council of 17 June 2008) is likely to accept jurisdiction over a dispute
    arising out

    of or in connection with the relevant acknowledgement letter.

    Authorised signatories

    1. 22 A firm is required, under CASS 7.18.9 R , to use reasonable endeavours to
    ensure

    that any individual that has countersigned an acknowledgement letter returned
    to the firm

    was authorised to countersign the letter on behalf of the relevant counterparty.

    2. 23 If an individual that has countersigned an acknowledgement letter does not
    provide

    the firm with sufficient evidence of his/her authority to do so then the firm
    is expected to

    make appropriate enquires to satisfy itself of that individual''s authority.

    3. 24 Evidence of an individual''s authority to countersign an acknowledgement
    letter may

    include a copy of the counterparty''s list of authorised signatories, a duly executed
    power of

    attorney, use of a company seal or bank stamp, and/or material verifying the title
    or position

    of the individual countersigning the acknowledgement letter.

    4. 25 A firm should ensure it obtains at least the same level of assurance over
    the authority

    of an individual to countersign the acknowledgement letter as the firm would seek
    when

    managing its own commercial arrangements.

    Third party administrators

    1. 26 If a firm uses a third party administrator (''TPA'') to carry out the administrative
    tasks of

    drafting, sending and processing a client bank account acknowledgement letter,
    the text

    "[Signed by [Name of Third Party Administrator] on behalf of [CASS Firm]]" should
    be

    inserted to confirm that the acknowledgement letter was signed by the TPA on behalf
    of the

    CASS 7 Client money rules www.handbook.fca.org.uk September 2025

    CASS

    firm.

    2. 27 In these circumstances, the firm should first provide the TPA with the requisite

    authority (such as a power of attorney) before the TPA will be able to sign the
    client bank

    account acknowledgement letter on the firm''s behalf. A firm should also ensure
    that the

    acknowledgement letter continues to be drafted on letter-headed paper belonging
    to the

    firm.

    Designated client bank accounts and designated client fund accounts

    1. 28 A firm must ensure that each of its client bank accounts follows the naming

    conventions prescribed in the Glossary. This includes ensuring that (i) all client
    bank

    accounts include the term ''client'' in their title; and (ii) all designated client
    bank accounts or

    designated client fund accounts include, as appropriate, the terms ''designated''
    or

    ''designated fund'' in their title, or in each case an appropriate abbreviation
    in circumstances

    where this is permitted by the Glossary definition.

    2. 29 All references to the term "Client Bank Account[s]" in a client bank account

    acknowledgement letter should also be made consistently in either the singular
    or plural, as

    appropriate.

    Indirect clearing arrangements

    1. 30 For use with client transaction accounts maintained with a clearing member
    who

    facilitates indirect clearing through a regulated clearing arrangement, the square-bracketed

    text in paragraph (d) of the template letter in CASS 7 Annex 3 should remain in
    the letter,

    and, depending on the instruments being indirectly cleared using those client
    transaction

    accounts, should include the reference to either or both the EMIR indirect clearing
    default

    management obligations and the MiFIR indirect clearing default management obligations.

    2. 31 All references to the term "Client Transaction Account[s]" in a client transaction

    account acknowledgement letter should be made consistently in either the singular
    or plural,

    as appropriate.

    Direct clearing arrangements

    1. 32 For use with client transaction accounts maintained with an authorised central

    counterparty in respect of a regulated clearing arrangement, a firm may identify
    whether

    each account is an omnibus client account or an individual client account in the
    space

    provided in the body of the template letter in CASS 7 Annex 4. For example, if
    using the

    table mentioned in paragraph 10 above, a firm may include an additional column
    in which

    for each account it includes the reference "Individual Client Account" or "Omnibus
    Client

    Account", as appropriate.

    2. 33 All references to the term "Client Transaction Account[s]" in an authorised
    central

    counterparty acknowledgement letter should be made consistently in either the
    singular or

    plural, as appropriate.

    Money market deposits

    1. 34 The client bank account acknowledgement letter in CASS 7 Annex 2 may be
    used with

    money market deposits identified as being client money.

    2. 35 A firm should ensure that client money placed in a money market deposit
    is clearly

    identified as client money (see CASS 7.13.15 G ).

    3. 36 Before a firm places client money in a money market deposit, it must have
    a client

    CASS 7 Client money rules www.handbook.fca.org.uk September 2025

    CASS

    bank account acknowledgement letter for that deposit. If the unique identifier
    which will be

    associated with a money market deposit consisting of client money is unable to
    be included

    in a client bank account acknowledgement letter before it is duly countersigned
    and returned

    to the firm, a firm should set out in the body of the letter: (a) the title and
    other account

    information for the client bank account from which the deposits will be placed
    with the bank;

    and (b) how the firm will notify the bank that a money market deposit placed with
    it consists

    of client money (eg, by the inclusion of the words ''Client Money Deposit'').
    For example, in

    the space provided in the template letter in CASS 7 Annex 2 which allows a firm
    to include

    the account title and a unique identifier for each relevant account/deposit, a
    firm should

    include a statement to the following effect:

    1.

    [[CASS Firm] money market deposits placed from [title of relevant [client bank

    account], [sort code], [account number]] and identified with the reference ''[Client

    Money Deposit]'' as being client money)]

    CASS

    (1) [deleted]

    (2) As a consequence of CASS 11.3.4R, in a CASS large debt management firm (including

    a not-for-profit debt advice body fitting into that category) the function described
    in CASS

    11.3.4R is required to be discharged by a director or senior manager.

    (3) [deleted]

    (4) [deleted]

    (4A) For an SMCR firm, the function in CASS 11.3.4R is not a separate controlled
    function

    and performing that function does not require approval as an approved person.
    Paragraphs

    (5) to (11) describe how CASS 11.3.4R applies to such firms.

    (4B) There are three elements of the regime for SMCR firms that are particularly
    relevant to

    CASS 11.3, although they do not all apply to all SMCR firms:

    (a) a firm’s obligation to allocate certain responsibilities to its SMF managers
    (see SYSC

    24 (Senior managers and certification regime: Allocation of prescribed responsibilities));

    (b) a firm’s obligation to ensure that one or more of its SMF managers have overall

    responsibility for each of its activities, business areas and management functions
    (see

    SYSC 26 (Senior managers and certification regime: Overall and local responsibility));

    and

    (c) the certification regime (the certification regime is explained in SYSC 27
    (Senior

    managers and certification regime: Certification regime) and SYSC TP 7 (Bank of

    England and Financial Services Act 2016: Certification and regulatory references)

    explains that the certification regime comes into force sometime after other parts
    of the

    senior managers and certification regime).

    (5) Paragraphs (6) to (9) explain how CASS 11.3.4R applies to an SMCR firm to
    which

    SYSC 24 and SYSC 26 apply.

    (6) The SMCR firm must allocate responsibility for the firm’s compliance with
    CASS to one

    of its SMF managers (see SYSC 24.2.1R). That responsibility is an “FCA-prescribed
    senior

    management responsibility”. The full list of FCA-prescribed senior management

    responsibilities is in the table in SYSC 24.2.6R.

    (7) Although the CASS function in SYSC 24.2.1R is different from the function
    in CASS

    11.3.4R, the SMCR firm may allocate the function in CASS 11.3.4R to the SMF manager
    in

    (6).

    (8) The SMCR firm may allocate the CASS FCA-prescribed senior management

    responsibility described in (6) to an SMF manager who does not perform any other
    function

    coming within the FCA regime for SMF managers in SMCR firms. See SUP 10C.7 (Other

    overall responsibility function (SMF18)) and SUP 10C.8.1R (Other local responsibility

    function (SMF22)) for details.

    (9) The SMCR firm may choose to allocate the function in CASS 11.3.4R to someone
    who is

    not an approved person and SMF manager. If so:

    (a) that person will be subject to the employee certification regime described
    in SYSC 27

    (Senior managers and certification regime: Certification regime);

    (b) that person will be subject to supervision by the SMF manager in (6); and

    (c) the function in CASS 11.3.4R will be the CASS oversight FCA certification
    function in

    CASS 11 Debt management client money chapter www.handbook.fca.org.uk September
    2025

    CASS

    SYSC 27.8.1R.

    (10) In relation to an SMCR firm to which SYSC 24 applies but SYSC 26 does not
    apply the

    guidance in paragraphs (6), (7) and (9) applies, but the guidance in paragraph
    (8) does not

    apply.

    (11)

    (a) The position of an SMCR firm to which neither SYSC 24 nor SYSC 26 apply is

    slightly different.

    (b) The firm may choose to allocate the function in CASS 11.3.4R to an SMF manager.

    (c) The firm may instead choose to allocate the CASS function to someone who is
    not an

    SMF manager.

    (d) Where (c) applies, the person performing the function in CASS 11.3.4R will
    fall into

    the certification regime. The function in CASS 1A.3.1AR will be the CASS oversight
    FCA

    certification function in SYSC 27.8.1R.

    (e) A not-for-profit debt advice body will not have any SMF managers as no controlled

    functions apply to it.'

    Section : CASS 11 Annex 2 Guidance notes for client bank account acknowledgement

    letters (CASS 11.8.5G)

    CASS 11 Annex 2 Introduction

    G 1.

    1. This annex contains guidance on the use of the template client bank account

    acknowledgement letters in CASS 11 Annex 1.

    General

    1.

    2. Under CASS 11.8.2 R (2), CASS debt management firms are required to have in
    place a

    duly signed and countersigned client bank account acknowledgement letter for a
    client bank

    account before they are allowed to hold or receive client money in or into the
    account.

    2.

    3. For each client bank account a CASS debt management firm is required to complete,
    sign

    and send to the approved bank a client bank account acknowledgement letter identifying

    that account and in the form set out in CASS 11 Annex 1 (CASS debt management
    firm

    client bank account acknowledgment letter template).

    3.

    4 . When completing a client bank account acknowledgement letter using the appropriate

    template, a CASS debt management firm is reminded that it must not amend any of
    the text

    which is not in square brackets (acknowledgment letter fixed text). A CASS debt

    management firm should also not amend the non-italicised text that is in square
    brackets. It

    may remove or include square bracketed text from the letter, or replace bracketed
    and

    italicised text with the required information, in either case as appropriate.
    The notes below

    give further guidance on this.

    Clear identification of relevant accounts

    1.

    5. A CASS debt management firm is reminded that for each client bank account it
    needs to

    have in place a client bank account acknowledgement letter. As a result, it is
    important that

    it is clear to which account or accounts each client bank account acknowledgement
    letter

    relates. As a result, the templates in CASS 11 Annex 1 require that the client
    bank account

    acknowledgement letter include the full title and at least one unique identifier,
    such as a sort

    code and account number, deposit number or reference code, for each client bank
    account.

    2.

    6. The title and unique identifiers included in a client bank account acknowledgement
    letter

    for a client bank account should be the same as those reflected in both the records
    of the

    CASS debt management firm and the relevant approved bank, as appropriate, for
    that

    account. Where an approved bank''s systems are not able to reflect the full title
    of an

    account, that title may be abbreviated to accommodate that system, provided that:

    1.

    (a) the account may continue to be appropriately identified in line with the requirements

    of CASS 11 (for example, ‘segregated’ may be shortened to ‘seg’, ‘account’ may
    be

    shortened to ‘acct’ etc); and

    CASS 11 Debt management client money chapter www.handbook.fca.org.uk September
    2025

    CASS

    2.

    (b) when completing a client bank account acknowledgement letter, such letter
    must

    include both the long and short versions of the account title.

    3.

    7. A CASS debt management firm should ensure that all relevant account information
    is

    contained in the space provided in the body of the client bank account acknowledgement

    letter. Nothing should be appended to a client bank account acknowledgement letter.

    4.

    8. In the space provided in the template letters for setting out the account title
    and unique

    identifiers for each relevant account/deposit, a CASS debt management firm firm
    may

    include the required information in the format of the following table:

    Full account title Unique identifier Title reflected in [name of

    approved bank] systems

    [Debt Management Firm [00-00-00 12345678] [DM FIRM CLIENT A/C]

    Client Bank Account]

    5.

    9. Where a client bank account acknowledgement letter is intended to cover a range
    of

    client bank accounts, some of which may not exist as at the date the client bank
    account

    acknowledgement letter is countersigned by the approved bank, a CASS debt management

    firm should set out in the space provided in the body of the client bank account

    acknowledgement letter that it is intended to apply to all present and future
    accounts which:

    (a) are titled in a specified way (e.g. with the word ‘client’ in their title);
    and (b) which

    possess a common unique identifier or which may be clearly identified by a range
    of unique

    identifiers (e.g. all accounts numbered between XXXX1111 and ZZZZ9999). For example,
    in

    the space provided in the template letter in CASS 11 Annex 1 which allows a CASS
    debt

    management firm to include the account title and a unique identifier for each
    relevant

    account, a CASS debt management firm should include a statement to the following
    effect:

    1.

    Any account open at present or to be opened in the future which contains the term

    [‘client’][insert appropriate abbreviation of the term ‘client’ as agreed and
    to be

    reflected in the Approved Bank’s systems] in its title and which may be identified

    with [the following [insert common unique identifier]][an account number from

    and including [XXXX1111] to and including [ZZZZ9999]][clearly identify range of

    unique identifiers].

    Signatures and countersignatures

    1.

    10. A CASS debt management firm should ensure that each client bank account

    acknowledgement letter is signed and countersigned by all relevant parties and
    individuals

    (including where a firm or the approved bank may require more than one signatory).

    2.

    CASS 11 Debt management client money chapter www.handbook.fca.org.uk September
    2025

    CASS

    11. A client bank account acknowledgement letter that is signed or countersigned

    electronically should not, for that reason alone, result in a breach of the rules
    in CASS 11.8.

    However, where electronic signatures are used, a CASS debt management firm should

    consider whether, taking into account the governing law and choice of competent

    jurisdiction, it needs to ensure that the electronic signature and the certification
    by any

    person of such signature would be admissible as evidence in any legal proceedings
    in the

    relevant jurisdiction in relation to any question as to the authenticity or integrity
    of the

    signature or any associated communication.

    Completing a client bank account acknowledgment letter

    1.

    12. A CASS debt management firm should use at least the same level of care and
    diligence

    when completing a client bank account acknowledgement letter as it would in managing
    its

    own commercial agreements.

    2.

    13. A CASS debt management firm should ensure that each client bank account

    acknowledgement letter is legible (e.g. any handwritten details should be easy
    to read),

    produced on the firm''s own letter-headed paper, dated and addressed to the correct
    legal

    entity (e.g. where the approved bank belongs to a group of companies).

    3.

    14. A CASS debt management firm should also ensure each client bank account

    acknowledgement letter includes all the required information (such as account
    names and

    numbers, the parties’ full names, addresses and contact information, and each
    signatory’s

    printed name and title).

    4.

    15. A CASS debt management firm should similarly ensure that no square brackets
    remain

    in the text of each client bank account acknowledgement letter (e.g. after having
    removed or

    included square bracketed text, as appropriate, or having replaced square bracketed
    and

    italicised text with the required information as indicated in the templates in
    CASS 11 Annex

    1) and that each page of the letter is numbered.

    5.

    16. A CASS debt management firm should complete a client bank account

    acknowledgement letter so that no part of the letter can be easily altered (e.g.
    the letter

    should be signed in ink rather than pencil).

    6.

    17. In respect of the client bank account acknowledgement letter''s governing
    law and choice

    of competent jurisdiction (see paragraphs (l) and (m) of the template client bank
    account

    acknowledgement letters), a CASS debt management firm should agree with the approved

    bank and reflect in the letter that the laws of a particular jurisdiction will
    govern the client

    bank account acknowledgement letter and that the courts of that same jurisdiction
    will have

    jurisdiction to settle any disputes arising out of, or in connection with, the
    client bank

    account acknowledgement letter, its subject matter or formation.

    7.

    CASS 11 Debt management client money chapter www.handbook.fca.org.uk September
    2025

    CASS

    18. If a CASS debt management firm does not, in any client bank account

    acknowledgement letter, utilise the governing law and choice of competent jurisdiction
    that

    is the same as either or both:

    1.

    (a) the laws of the jurisdiction under which either the firm or the relevant approved
    bank

    are organised; or

    2.

    (b) as is found in the underlying agreement/s (e.g. banking services agreement)
    with the

    relevant approved bank;

    then the CASS debt management firm should consider whether it is at risk of breaching

    either CASS 11.8.4 R (3) or, if it is a CASS large debt management firm, CASS
    11.7.2 R.

    Authorised signatories

    1.

    19. A CASS debt management firm is required under CASS 11.8.7 R to use reasonable

    endeavours to ensure that any individual that has countersigned a client bank
    account

    acknowledgement letter returned to the firm was authorised to countersign the
    letter on

    behalf of the relevant approved bank.

    2.

    20. If an individual that has countersigned a client bank account acknowledgement
    letter

    does not provide the CASS debt management firm with sufficient evidence of his/her

    authority to do so then the CASS debt management firm is expected to make appropriate

    enquiries to satisfy itself of that individual’s authority.

    3.

    21. Evidence of an individual’s authority to countersign a client bank account

    acknowledgement letter may include a copy of the approved bank''s list of authorised

    signatories, a duly executed power of attorney, use of a company seal or bank
    stamp,

    and/or material verifying the title or position of the individual countersigning
    the client bank

    account acknowledgement letter.

    4.

    22. A CASS debt management firm should ensure it obtains at least the same level
    of

    assurance over the authority of an individual to countersign the client bank account

    acknowledgement letter as the firm would seek when managing its own commercial

    arrangements.

    Third party administrators

    1.

    23. If a CASS debt management firm uses a third party administrator (TPA) to carry
    out the

    administrative tasks of drafting, sending and processing a client bank account

    acknowledgement letter, the text "[Signed by [Name of Third Party Administrator]
    on

    behalf of [CASS debt management firm]]" should be inserted to confirm that the
    client bank

    account acknowledgement letter was signed by the TPA on behalf of the CASS debt

    management firm.

    2.

    CASS 11 Debt management client money chapter www.handbook.fca.org.uk September
    2025

    CASS

    24. In these circumstances, the CASS debt management firm should first provide
    the TPA

    with the requisite authority (such as a power of attorney) before the TPA will
    be able to sign

    the client bank account acknowledgement letter on the CASS debt management firm''s

    behalf. A CASS debt management firm should also ensure that the client bank account

    acknowledgement letter continues to be drafted on letter-headed paper belonging
    to the

    CASS debt management firm.

    Client bank accounts

    1.

    25. A CASS debt management firm must ensure that each of its client bank accounts

    follows the naming conventions prescribed in the Glossary. This includes ensuring
    that all

    client bank accounts include the term ‘client’ in their title or an appropriate
    abbreviation in

    circumstances where this is permitted by the Glossary definition.

    2.

    26. All references to the term “Client Bank Account[s]” in a client bank account

    acknowledgement letter should also be made consistently in either the singular
    or plural, as

    appropriate.

    senior managers
  summary: null
  risk_ids: []
  default_control_ids: []
  applicability_conditions: null
  text: 'and certification regime. This paragraph does not deal with a firm that is
    a PRA-authorised

    person.

    (2) The senior managers and certification regime is summarised in SYSC 23.3 (Overview
    of

    the senior managers and certification regime).

    (3) The function in CASS 13.2.3R is not a separate controlled function and performing
    that

    function does not require approval as an approved person.

    (4) There are three elements of the senior managers and certification regime that
    are

    particularly relevant to CASS 13.2.3R, although they do not all apply to all SMCR
    firms:

    (a) a firm’s obligation to allocate certain responsibilities to its SMF managers
    (see SYSC

    24 (Senior managers and certification regime: Allocation of prescribed responsibilities));

    (b) a firm’s obligation to ensure that one or more of its SMF managers have overall

    responsibility for each of its activities, business areas and management functions
    (see

    SYSC 26 (Senior managers and certification regime: Overall and local responsibility));

    and

    (c) the certification regime (the certification regime is explained in SYSC 27
    (Senior

    CASS 13 Claims management: client money www.handbook.fca.org.uk September 2025

    CASS

    managers and certification regime: Certification regime) and SYSC TP 7 (Bank of

    England and Financial Services Act 2016: Certification and regulatory references)

    explains that the certification regime comes into force sometime after other parts
    of the

    senior managers and certification regime).

    (5)

    (a) This paragraph (5) explains how CASS 13.2.3R applies to a limited scope SMCR

    firm. Most firms carrying on a regulated claims management activity will be limited
    scope

    SMCR firms.

    (b) Neither SYSC 24 nor SYSC 26 applies to a limited scope SMCR firm.

    (c) The firm may choose to allocate the function in CASS 13.2.3R to an SMF manager.

    (d) The firm may instead choose to allocate the function in CASS 13.2.3R to someone

    who is not an SMF manager.

    (e) Where (d) applies, the person performing the function in CASS 13.2.3R will
    fall into

    the certification regime. The function in CASS 13.2.3R will be the CASS oversight
    FCA

    certification function in SYSC 27.8.1R.

    (6)

    (a) This paragraph (6) explains how CASS 13.2.3R applies to a core SMCR firm.

    (b) SYSC 24 applies to a core SMCR firm but SYSC 26 does not.

    (c) The firm must allocate responsibility for the firm’s compliance with CASS
    to one of its

    SMF managers (see SYSC 24.2.1R). That responsibility is an “FCA-prescribed senior

    management responsibility”. The full list of FCA-prescribed senior management

    responsibilities is in the table in SYSC 24.2.6R.

    (d) Although the CASS function in SYSC 24.2.1R is different from the function
    in CASS

    13.2.3R, the firm may allocate the function in CASS 13.2.3R to the SMF manager
    in'

    27 (Senior

    managers and certification regime: Certification regime);

    (ii) that person will be subject to supervision by the SMF manager in (c); and

    (iii) the function in CASS 13.2.3R will be the CASS oversight FCA certification

    function in SYSC 27.8.1R.

    (7)

    (a) This paragraph (7) explains how CASS 13.2.3R applies to an enhanced scope

    SMCR firm.

    (b) Both SYSC 24 and SYSC 26 apply to an enhanced scope SMCR firm.

    (c) CASS 13.2.5G(6) applies to an enhanced scope SMCR firm.

    (d) In addition, the firm may allocate the CASS FCA-prescribed senior management

    responsibility to an SMF manager who does not perform any other function coming

    within the FCA regime for SMF managers in SMCR firms. See SUP 10C0.7 (Other

    overall responsibility function (SMF18)) and SUP 10C.8.1R (Other local responsibility

    function (SMF22)) for details. Where this is the case, the manager will be performing
    the

    CASS 13 Claims management: client money www.handbook.fca.org.uk September 2025

    CASS

    other overall responsibility function or the other local responsibility function.

    (8) A firm may only give the function in CASS 13.2.3R to a director or senior
    manager. It is

    likely that an SMF manager will satisfy this condition. If the firm wants to give
    the function to

    someone else, it should make sure that it meets the requirements of CASS 13.2.3R
    as well

    as of the senior managers and certification regime.

    Section : CASS 13 Annex 2 Guidance notes for client bank account acknowledgement

    letters (CASS 13.5.5G)

    CASS 13 Annex Introduction

    2G G 1. This annex contains guidance on the use of the template client bank account

    acknowledgement letters in CASS 13 Annex 1R.

    General

    2. Under CASS 13.5.2R(2), firms are required to have in place a duly signed and
    countersigned

    client bank account acknowledgement letter for a client bank account before they
    are allowed to

    hold or receive client money in or into the account.

    3. For each client bank account a firm is required to complete, sign and send
    to the approved

    bank a client bank account acknowledgement letter identifying that account and
    in the form set

    out in CASS 13 Annex 1R (CASS claims management firm client bank account

    acknowledgment letter template).

    4. When completing a client bank account acknowledgement letter using the appropriate

    template, a firm is reminded that it must not amend any of the text which is not
    in square

    brackets (acknowledgment letter fixed text). A firm should also not amend the
    non-italicised text

    that is in square brackets. It may remove or include square bracketed text from
    the letter, or

    replace bracketed and italicised text with the required information, in either
    case as appropriate.

    The notes below give further guidance on this.

    Clear identification of relevant accounts

    5. A firm is reminded that for each client bank account it needs to have in place
    a client bank

    account acknowledgement letter. As a result, it is important that it is clear
    to which account or

    accounts each client bank account acknowledgement letter relates. As a result,
    the template in

    CASS 13 Annex 1R requires that the client bank account acknowledgement letter
    includes the

    full title and at least one unique identifier, such as a sort code and account
    number, deposit

    number or reference code, for each client bank account.

    6. The title and unique identifiers included in a client bank account acknowledgement
    letter for a

    client bank account should be the same as those reflected in both the records
    of the firm and

    the relevant approved bank, as appropriate, for that account. Where an approved
    bank’s

    systems are not able to reflect the full title of an account, that title may be
    abbreviated to

    accommodate that system, provided that:

    (a) the account may continue to be appropriately identified in line with the requirements
    of

    CASS 13 (for example, ‘segregated’ may be shortened to ‘seg’, ‘account’ may be
    shortened

    to ‘acct’ etc); and

    (b) when completing a client bank account acknowledgement letter, such letter
    must include

    both the long and short versions of the account title.

    7. A firm should ensure that all relevant account information is contained in
    the space provided

    in the body of the client bank account acknowledgement letter. Nothing should
    be appended to

    a client bank account acknowledgement letter.

    8. In the space provided in the template letter for setting out the account title
    and unique

    identifiers for each relevant account/deposit, a firm may include the required
    information in the

    format of the following table:

    CASS 13 Claims management: client money www.handbook.fca.org.uk September 2025

    CASS

    Full account title Unique identifier Title reflected in [name of

    approved bank] systems

    [Claims Management Firm [00-00-00 12345678] [CM FIRM CLIENT A/C]

    Client Bank Account]

    9. Where a client bank account acknowledgement letter is intended to cover a range
    of client

    bank accounts, some of which may not exist as at the date the client bank account

    acknowledgement letter is countersigned by the approved bank, a firm should set
    out in the

    space provided in the body of the client bank account acknowledgement letter that
    it is intended

    to apply to all present and future accounts which: (a) are titled in a specified
    way (e.g. with the

    word ‘client’ in their title); and (b) which possess a common unique identifier
    or which may be

    clearly identified by a range of unique identifiers (e.g. all accounts numbered
    between

    XXXX1111 and ZZZZ9999). For example, in the space provided in the template letter
    in CASS

    13 Annex 1R which allows a firm to include the account title and a unique identifier
    for each

    relevant account, a firm should include a statement to the following effect:

    1. Any account open at present or to be opened in the future which contains the
    term

    [‘client’][insert appropriate abbreviation of the term ‘client’ as agreed and
    to be

    reflected in the Approved Bank’s systems] in its title and which may be identified
    with

    [the following [insert common unique identifier]][an account number from and

    including [XXXX1111] to and including [ZZZZ9999]][clearly identify range of unique

    identifiers].

    Signatures and countersignatures

    10. A firm should ensure that each client bank account acknowledgement letter
    is signed and

    countersigned by all relevant parties and individuals (including where a firm
    or the approved

    bank may require more than one signatory).

    11. A client bank account acknowledgement letter that is signed or countersigned
    electronically

    should not, for that reason alone, result in a breach of the rules in CASS 13.5.
    However, where

    electronic signatures are used, a firm should consider whether, taking into account
    the

    governing law and choice of competent jurisdiction, it needs to ensure that the
    electronic

    signature and the certification by any person of such signature would be admissible
    as

    evidence in any legal proceedings in the relevant jurisdiction in relation to
    any question as to

    the authenticity or integrity of the signature or any associated communication.

    Completing a client bank account acknowledgment letter

    12. A firm should use at least the same level of care and diligence when completing
    a client

    bank account acknowledgement letter as it would in managing its own commercial
    agreements.

    13. A firm should ensure that each client bank account acknowledgement letter
    is legible (e.g.

    any handwritten details should be easy to read), produced on the firm’s own letter-headed

    paper, dated and addressed to the correct legal entity (e.g. where the approved
    bank belongs

    to a group of companies).

    14. A firm should also ensure each client bank account acknowledgement letter
    includes all the

    required information (such as account names and numbers, the parties’ full names,
    addresses

    and contact information, and each signatory’s printed name and title).

    15. A firm should similarly ensure that no square brackets remain in the text
    of each client bank

    account acknowledgement letter (e.g. after having removed or included square bracketed
    text,

    as appropriate, or having replaced square bracketed and italicised text with the
    required

    CASS 13 Claims management: client money www.handbook.fca.org.uk September 2025

    CASS

    information as indicated in the template in CASS 13 Annex 1R) and that each page
    of the letter

    is numbered.

    16. A firm should complete a client bank account acknowledgement letter so that
    no part of the

    letter can be easily altered (e.g. the letter should be signed in ink rather than
    pencil).

    17. In respect of the client bank account acknowledgement letter’s governing law
    and choice of

    competent jurisdiction (see paragraphs (11) and (12) of the template client bank
    account

    acknowledgement letters), a firm should agree with the approved bank and reflect
    in the letter

    that the laws of a particular jurisdiction will govern the client bank account
    acknowledgement

    letter and that the courts of that same jurisdiction will have jurisdiction to
    settle any disputes

    arising out of, or in connection with, the client bank account acknowledgement
    letter, its subject

    matter or formation.

    18. If a firm does not, in any client bank account acknowledgement letter, utilise
    the governing

    law and choice of competent jurisdiction that is the same as either or both:

    (a) the laws of the jurisdiction under which either the firm or the relevant approved
    bank are

    organised; or

    (b) as is found in the underlying agreement/s (e.g. banking services agreement)
    with the

    relevant approved bank;

    then the firm should consider whether it is at risk of breaching CASS 13.5.4R(3)
    or CASS

    13.4.2R.

    Authorised signatories

    19 .A firm is required under CASS 13.5.7R to use reasonable endeavours to ensure
    that any

    individual that has countersigned a client bank account acknowledgement letter
    returned to the

    firm was authorised to countersign the letter on behalf of the relevant approved
    bank.

    20. If an individual that has countersigned a client bank account acknowledgement
    letter does

    not provide the firm with sufficient evidence of their authority to do so then
    the firm is expected

    to make appropriate enquiries to satisfy itself of that individual’s authority.

    21. Evidence of an individual’s authority to countersign a client bank account
    acknowledgement

    letter may include a copy of the approved bank’s list of authorised signatories,
    a duly executed

    power of attorney, use of a company seal or bank stamp, and/or material verifying
    the title or

    position of the individual countersigning the client bank account acknowledgement
    letter.

    22. A firm should ensure it obtains at least the same level of assurance over
    the authority of an

    individual to countersign the client bank account acknowledgement letter as the
    firm would seek

    when managing its own commercial arrangements.

    Third party administrators

    23. If a firm uses a third party administrator (TPA) to carry out the administrative
    tasks of

    drafting, sending and processing a client bank account acknowledgement letter,
    the text

    “[Signed by [Name of Third Party Administrator] on behalf of [firm]]” should be
    inserted to

    confirm that the client bank account acknowledgement letter was signed by the
    TPA on behalf

    of the firm.

    24. In these circumstances, the firm should first provide the TPA with the requisite
    authority

    (such as a power of attorney) before the TPA will be able to sign the client bank
    account

    acknowledgement letter on the firm’s behalf. A firm should also ensure that the
    client bank

    account acknowledgement letter continues to be drafted on letter-headed paper
    belonging to

    the firm.

    CASS 13 Claims management: client money www.handbook.fca.org.uk September 2025

    CASS

    Client bank accounts

    25. A firm must ensure that each of its client bank accounts follows the naming
    conventions

    prescribed in the Glossary. This includes ensuring that all client bank accounts
    include the term

    ‘client’ in their title or an appropriate abbreviation in circumstances where
    this is permitted by

    the Glossary definition.

    26. All references to the term “Client Bank Account[s]” in a client bank account

    acknowledgement letter should also be made consistently in either the singular
    or plural, as

    appropriate.
