    for client s'' assets when the firm is responsible for them. An essential part
    of that protection is the proper accounting and handling of client money . The
    rules in CASS 5.1 to CASS 5.6 also give effect to the requirement in article 10.6
    of the IDD that all necessary measures should be taken to protect clients against
    the inability of an insurance intermediary to transfer premiums to an insurance
    undertaking or to transfer the proceeds of a claim or premium refund to the insured.


    (2) There are two particular approaches which firms can adopt which reflect options
    given in article 10.6. The first is to provide by law or contract for a transfer
    of risk from the insurance intermediary to the insurance undertaking ( CASS 5.2
    ). The second is that client money is strictly segregated by being transferred
    to client accounts that cannot be used to reimburse other creditors in the event
    of the firm''s insolvency ( CASS 5.3 and CASS 5.4 provide different means of achieving
    such segregation). CASS 5.1.5A R permits a firm subject to certain conditions
    to treat money which it collects as agent of an insurance undertaking as client
    money ; the principle of strict segregation is, however, satisfied because such
    undertakings must agree to their interests being subordinated to the interests
    of the firm''s other clients .'

  text: The custody rules do not apply if a firm temporarily handles a safe custody
    asset belonging to a client . A firm should temporarily handle a safe custody
    asset for no longer than is reasonably necessary. In most transactions this would
    be no longer than one business day , but it may be longer or shorter depending
    upon the transaction in question. For example, when a firm executes an order to
    sell shares which have not been registered on a de-materialised exchange, handling
    documents for longer periods may be reasonably necessary. However, in the case
    of safe custody assets in bearer form , the firm is expected to handle them for
    less than one business day . When a firm temporarily handles safe custody assets
    , it is still obliged to comply with Principle 10 (Clients' assets).

    be received by the firm . Consistent with the requirement to hold client money
    as trustee (see CASS 7.17.5 G ), a firm should ensure its organisational arrangements
    are adequate to minimise such a risk. This may include, for example, allowing
    for sufficient periods of time for payments of client money to the firm to become
    available for use (including automated payments, credit card payments and payments
    by cheque), and setting up safeguards to ensure that payments out of client bank
