    rights to the asset, so that when the firm exercises its right to treat the asset

    firm's asset and is no longer in need of the full range of client asset protection.

    of that protection is the proper accounting and handling of client money . The

    of the IDD that all necessary measures should be taken to protect clients against
    the inability of an insurance intermediary to transfer premiums to an insurance
    undertaking or to transfer the proceeds of a claim or premium


    (2) There are two particular approaches which firms can adopt which reflect options
    given in article 10.6. The first is to provide by law or contract for a transfer
    of risk from the insurance intermediary to the insurance undertaking ( CASS 5.2
    ). The second is that client money is strictly segregated by being transferred
    to client accounts that cannot be used to reimburse other creditors in the event
    of the firm''s insolvency ( CASS 5.3 and CASS 5.4 provide different means of achieving
    such segregation). CASS 5.1.5A R permits a firm subject to certain conditions
    to treat money which it collects as agent of an insurance undertaking as client
    money ; the principle of strict segregation is, however, satisfied because such
    undertakings must agree to their interests being subordinated to the interests

    for example, a firm passes client money to a clearing house in the form of margin

    to hold client money in respect of the firm's client's non-margined transactions

    An acknowledgement letter that is signed or countersigned electronically should
    not, for that reason alone, result in a breach of the rules in CASS 7.19 . However,

    it needs to ensure that the electronic signature and the certification by any

    to clarify through additional words in the governing law provision (see paragraph
    (l) of the template in CASS 7 Annex 2 and paragraph (k) of the template in CASS

    is no restriction as to what additional words may be used (eg, additional words
    such circumstances), but a firm should at all times have regard to the need to
    comply with CASS 7.18.6 R (3) . However, for the majority of firms the FCA does
    not expect additional wording for the governing law provision to be necessary.

    continues to be drafted on letter-headed paper belonging to the 1. 28 A firm must

    a client bank account acknowledgement letter should also be made consistently

    maintained with a clearing member who facilitates indirect clearing through a
    regulated clearing arrangement , the square-bracketed text in paragraph (d) of
    the template letter in CASS 7 Annex 3 should remain in the letter, and, depending
    on the instruments being indirectly cleared using those client transaction accounts
    , should include the reference to either or both the EMIR indirect clearing default
    management obligations and the MiFIR indirect clearing default management obligations
    . 2. 31 All references to the term "Client Transaction Account[s]" in a client
    transaction account acknowledgement letter should be made consistently in either

    individual client account in the space provided in the body of the template letter
    in CASS 7 Annex 4 . For example, if using the table mentioned in paragraph 10
    above, a firm may include an additional column in which for each account it includes
    the reference "Individual Client Account" or "Omnibus Client 2. 33 All references
    to the term "Client Transaction Account[s]" in an authorised central counterparty

    is clearly 3. 36 Before a firm places client money in a money market deposit,
    it must have a client CASS bank account acknowledgement letter for that deposit.
    If the unique identifier which will be associated with a money market deposit
    consisting of client money is unable to be included in a client bank account acknowledgement
    letter before it is duly countersigned and returned to the firm , a firm should
    set out in the body of the letter: (a) the title and other account information
    for the client bank account from which the deposits will be placed with the bank;
    and (b) how the firm will notify the bank that a money market deposit placed with
    it consists of client money (eg, by the inclusion of the words ''Client Money
    Deposit''). For example, in the space provided in the template letter in CASS

  text: '2. Under CASS 11.8.2 R (2) , CASS debt management firms are required to have
    in place a duly signed and countersigned client bank account acknowledgement letter
    for a client bank account before they are allowed to hold or receive client money
    in or into the account. 3. For each client bank account a CASS debt management
    firm is required to complete, sign and send to the approved bank a client bank
    account acknowledgement letter identifying that account and in the form set out
    in CASS 11 Annex 1 (CASS debt management firm 4 . When completing a client bank
    account acknowledgement letter using the appropriate template, a CASS debt management
    firm is reminded that it must not amend any of the text which is not in square
    brackets (acknowledgment letter fixed text). A CASS debt management firm should
    also not amend the non-italicised text that is in square brackets. It may remove
    or include square bracketed text from the letter, or replace bracketed and italicised
    text with the required information, in either case as appropriate. The notes below
    5. A CASS debt management firm is reminded that for each client bank account it
    needs to have in place a client bank account acknowledgement letter . As a result,
    it is important that it is clear to which account or accounts each client bank
    account acknowledgement letter relates. As a result, the templates in CASS 11
    Annex 1 require that the client bank account acknowledgement letter include the
    full title and at least one unique identifier, such as a sort code and account
    number, deposit number or reference code, for each client bank account . 6. The
    title and unique identifiers included in a client bank account acknowledgement
    letter for a client bank account should be the same as those reflected in both
    the records of the CASS debt management firm and the relevant approved bank ,
    as appropriate, for that account. Where an approved bank''s systems are not able
    to reflect the full title of an account, that title may be abbreviated to accommodate
    that system, provided that:


    (a) the account may continue to be appropriately identified in line with the requirements
    of CASS 11 (for example, ‘segregated’ may be shortened to ‘seg’, ‘account’ may
    be CASS


    (b) when completing a client bank account acknowledgement letter , such letter
    must include both the long and short versions of the account title. 7. A CASS
    debt management firm should ensure that all relevant account information is contained
    in the space provided in the body of the client bank account acknowledgement letter
    . Nothing should be appended to a client bank account acknowledgement letter .
    8. In the space provided in the template letters for setting out the account title
    and unique identifiers for each relevant account/deposit, a CASS debt management
    firm firm may include the required information in the format of the following
    table:


    Full account title Unique identifier Title reflected in [ name of approved bank
    ] systems [ Debt Management Firm [ 00-00-00 12345678 ] [ DM FIRM CLIENT A/C ]
    9. Where a client bank account acknowledgement letter is intended to cover a range
    of client bank accounts , some of which may not exist as at the date the client
    bank account acknowledgement letter is countersigned by the approved bank , a
    CASS debt management firm should set out in the space provided in the body of
    the client bank account acknowledgement letter that it is intended to apply to
    all present and future accounts which:


    (a) are titled in a specified way (e.g. with the word ‘client’ in their title);
    and (b) which possess a common unique identifier or which may be clearly identified
    by a range of unique identifiers (e.g. all accounts numbered between XXXX1111
    and ZZZZ9999). For example, in the space provided in the template letter in CASS
    11 Annex 1 which allows a CASS debt management firm to include the account title
    and a unique identifier for each relevant account, a CASS debt management firm
    should include a statement to the following effect:


    Any account open at present or to be opened in the future which contains the term
    [‘client’][insert appropriate abbreviation of the term ‘client’ as agreed and
    to be reflected in the Approved Bank’s systems] in its title and which may be
    identified with [the following [insert common unique identifier]][an account number
    from and including [XXXX1111] to and including [ZZZZ9999]][clearly identify range
    of 10. A CASS debt management firm should ensure that each client bank account
    acknowledgement letter is signed and countersigned by all relevant parties and
    individuals (including where a firm or the approved bank may require more than
    one signatory). CASS 11. A client bank account acknowledgement letter that is
    signed or countersigned electronically should not, for that reason alone, result
    in a breach of the rules in CASS 11.8 . However, where electronic signatures are
    used, a CASS debt management firm should consider whether, taking into account
    the governing law and choice of competent jurisdiction, it needs to ensure that
    the electronic signature and the certification by any person of such signature
    would be admissible as evidence in any legal proceedings in the relevant jurisdiction
    in relation to any question as to the authenticity or integrity of the 12. A CASS
    debt management firm should use at least the same level of care and diligence
    when completing a client bank account acknowledgement letter as it would in managing
    its 13. A CASS debt management firm should ensure that each client bank account
    acknowledgement letter is legible (e.g. any handwritten details should be easy
    to read), produced on the firm''s own letter-headed paper, dated and addressed
    to the correct legal 14. A CASS debt management firm should also ensure each client
    bank account acknowledgement letter includes all the required information (such
    as account names and numbers, the parties’ full names, addresses and contact information,
    and each signatory’s 15. A CASS debt management firm should similarly ensure that
    no square brackets remain in the text of each client bank account acknowledgement
    letter (e.g. after having removed or included square bracketed text, as appropriate,
    or having replaced square bracketed and italicised text with the required information
    as indicated in the templates in CASS 11 Annex acknowledgement letter so that
    no part of the letter can be easily altered (e.g. the letter 17. In respect of
    the client bank account acknowledgement letter''s governing law and choice of
    competent jurisdiction (see paragraphs (l) and (m) of the template client bank
    account acknowledgement letters ), a CASS debt management firm should agree with
    the approved bank and reflect in the letter that the laws of a particular jurisdiction
    will govern the client bank account acknowledgement letter and that the courts
    of that same jurisdiction will have jurisdiction to settle any disputes arising
    out of, or in connection with, the client bank CASS acknowledgement letter , utilise
    the governing law and choice of competent jurisdiction that

    the CASS debt management firm's behalf. A CASS debt management firm should also
    ensure that the client bank account acknowledgement letter continues to be drafted
    on letter-headed paper belonging to the 25. A CASS debt management firm must ensure
    that each of its client bank accounts follows the naming conventions prescribed

    (4) There are three elements of the senior managers and certification regime that
    are particularly relevant to CASS 13.2.3R , although they do not all apply to
    all SMCR firms :


    (a) a firm’s obligation to allocate certain responsibilities to its SMF managers
    (see SYSC 24 (Senior managers and certification regime: Allocation of prescribed
    responsibilities));


    (b) a firm’s obligation to ensure that one or more of its SMF managers have overall
    responsibility for each of its activities, business areas and management functions
    (see SYSC 26 (Senior managers and certification regime: Overall and local responsibility));


    (c) the certification regime (the certification regime is explained in SYSC 27

    firm . Most firms carrying on a regulated claims management activity will be limited
    scope


    (c) The firm may choose to allocate the function in CASS 13.2.3R to an SMF manager
    .


    (d) The firm may instead choose to allocate the function in CASS 13.2.3R to someone


    (e) Where (d) applies, the person performing the function in CASS 13.2.3R will
    fall into the certification regime. The function in CASS 13.2.3R will be the CASS
    oversight FCA


    (a) This paragraph (6) explains how CASS 13.2.3R applies to a core SMCR firm .


    (c) The firm must allocate responsibility for the firm’s compliance with CASS
    to one of its SMF managers (see SYSC 24.2.1R ). That responsibility is an “ FCA-prescribed
    senior management responsibility ”. The full list of FCA-prescribed senior management

    manager in

    (ii) that person will be subject to supervision by the SMF manager in (c); and


    (iii) the function in CASS 13.2.3R will be the CASS oversight FCA certification


    (a) This paragraph (7) explains how CASS 13.2.3R applies to an enhanced scope


    (d) In addition, the firm may allocate the CASS FCA-prescribed senior management
    responsibility to an SMF manager who does not perform any other function coming
    within the FCA regime for SMF managers in SMCR firms . See SUP 10C0.7 (Other overall
    responsibility function (SMF18)) and SUP 10C.8.1R (Other local responsibility

    the CASS other overall responsibility function or the other local responsibility
    function .


    (8) A firm may only give the function in CASS 13.2.3R to a director or senior
    manager . It is likely that an SMF manager will satisfy this condition. If the
    firm wants to give the function to someone else, it should make sure that it meets

    13 Annex 2 Guidance notes for client bank account acknowledgement 2. Under CASS
    13.5.2R(2) , firms are required to have in place a duly signed and countersigned
    client bank account acknowledgement letter for a client bank account before they
    are allowed to 3. For each client bank account a firm is required to complete,
    sign and send to the approved bank a client bank account acknowledgement letter
    identifying that account and in the form set 4. When completing a client bank
    account acknowledgement letter using the appropriate template, a firm is reminded
    that it must not amend any of the text which is not in square brackets (acknowledgment
    letter fixed text). A firm should also not amend the non-italicised text that
    is in square brackets. It may remove or include square bracketed text from the
    letter, or replace bracketed and italicised text with the required information,
    in either case as appropriate. 5. A firm is reminded that for each client bank
    account it needs to have in place a client bank account acknowledgement letter
    . As a result, it is important that it is clear to which account or accounts each
    client bank account acknowledgement letter relates. As a result, the template
    in CASS 13 Annex 1R requires that the client bank account acknowledgement letter
    includes the full title and at least one unique identifier, such as a sort code
    and account number, deposit 6. The title and unique identifiers included in a
    client bank account acknowledgement letter for a client bank account should be
    the same as those reflected in both the records of the firm and the relevant approved
    bank , as appropriate, for that account. Where an approved bank’s systems are
    not able to reflect the full title of an account, that title may be abbreviated
    to


    (a) the account may continue to be appropriately identified in line with the requirements
    of CASS 13 (for example, ‘segregated’ may be shortened to ‘seg’, ‘account’ may
    be shortened


    (b) when completing a client bank account acknowledgement letter , such letter
    must include 7. A firm should ensure that all relevant account information is
    contained in the space provided in the body of the client bank account acknowledgement
    letter . Nothing should be appended to 8. In the space provided in the template
    letter for setting out the account title and unique identifiers for each relevant
    account/deposit, a firm may include the required information in the CASS Full
    account title Unique identifier Title reflected in [ name of approved bank ] systems
    [ Claims Management Firm [ 00-00-00 12345678 ] [ CM FIRM CLIENT A/C ] 9. Where
    a client bank account acknowledgement letter is intended to cover a range of client
    bank accounts , some of which may not exist as at the date the client bank account
    acknowledgement letter is countersigned by the approved bank , a firm should set
    out in the space provided in the body of the client bank account acknowledgement
    letter that it is intended to apply to all present and future accounts which:
    (a) are titled in a specified way (e.g. with the word ‘client’ in their title);
    and (b) which possess a common unique identifier or which may be clearly identified
    by a range of unique identifiers (e.g. all accounts numbered between XXXX1111
    and ZZZZ9999). For example, in the space provided in the template letter in CASS
    13 Annex 1R which allows a firm to include the account title and a unique identifier
    for each relevant account, a firm should include a statement to the following
    effect:


    1. Any account open at present or to be opened in the future which contains the
    term [‘client’][insert appropriate abbreviation of the term ‘client’ as agreed
    and to be reflected in the Approved Bank’s systems] in its title and which may
    be identified with [the following [insert common unique identifier]][an account
    number from and including [XXXX1111] to and including [ZZZZ9999]][clearly identify
    range of unique 10. A firm should ensure that each client bank account acknowledgement
    letter is signed and countersigned by all relevant parties and individuals (including
    where a firm or the approved 11. A client bank account acknowledgement letter
    that is signed or countersigned electronically should not, for that reason alone,
    result in a breach of the rules in CASS 13.5 . However, where electronic signatures
    are used, a firm should consider whether, taking into account the governing law
    and choice of competent jurisdiction, it needs to ensure that the electronic signature
    and the certification by any person of such signature would be admissible as evidence
    in any legal proceedings in the relevant jurisdiction in relation to any question
    as to the authenticity or integrity of the signature or any associated communication.
    12. A firm should use at least the same level of care and diligence when completing
    a client bank account acknowledgement letter as it would in managing its own commercial
    agreements. 13. A firm should ensure that each client bank account acknowledgement
    letter is legible (e.g. any handwritten details should be easy to read), produced
    on the firm’s own letter-headed paper, dated and addressed to the correct legal
    entity (e.g. where the approved bank belongs 14. A firm should also ensure each
    client bank account acknowledgement letter includes all the required information
    (such as account names and numbers, the parties’ full names, addresses and contact
    information, and each signatory’s printed name and title). 15. A firm should similarly
    ensure that no square brackets remain in the text of each client bank account
    acknowledgement letter (e.g. after having removed or included square bracketed
    text, as appropriate, or having replaced square bracketed and italicised text
    with the required CASS information as indicated in the template in CASS 13 Annex
    1R ) and that each page of the letter 16. A firm should complete a client bank
    account acknowledgement letter so that no part of the letter can be easily altered
    (e.g. the letter should be signed in ink rather than pencil). 17. In respect of
    the client bank account acknowledgement letter’s governing law and choice of competent
    jurisdiction (see paragraphs (11) and (12) of the template client bank account
    acknowledgement letters ), a firm should agree with the approved bank and reflect
    in the letter that the laws of a particular jurisdiction will govern the client
    bank account acknowledgement letter and that the courts of that same jurisdiction
    will have jurisdiction to settle any disputes arising out of, or in connection
    with, the client bank account acknowledgement letter , its subject 18. If a firm
    does not, in any client bank account acknowledgement letter , utilise the governing


    (a) the laws of the jurisdiction under which either the firm or the relevant approved
    bank are


    (b) as is found in the underlying agreement/s (e.g. banking services agreement)
    with the then the firm should consider whether it is at risk of breaching CASS
    13.5.4R(3) or CASS 19 .A firm is required under CASS 13.5.7R to use reasonable
    endeavours to ensure that any individual that has countersigned a client bank
    account acknowledgement letter returned to the firm was authorised to countersign
    the letter on behalf of the relevant approved bank . 20. If an individual that
    has countersigned a client bank account acknowledgement letter does not provide
    the firm with sufficient evidence of their authority to do so then the firm is
    expected 21. Evidence of an individual’s authority to countersign a client bank
    account acknowledgement letter may include a copy of the approved bank’s list
    of authorised signatories, a duly executed power of attorney, use of a company
    seal or bank stamp, and/or material verifying the title or position of the individual
    countersigning the client bank account acknowledgement letter . 22. A firm should
    ensure it obtains at least the same level of assurance over the authority of an
    individual to countersign the client bank account acknowledgement letter as the
    firm would seek 23. If a firm uses a third party administrator (TPA) to carry
    out the administrative tasks of drafting, sending and processing a client bank
    account acknowledgement letter , the text “[Signed by [ Name of Third Party Administrator
    ] on behalf of [ firm ]]” should be inserted to confirm that the client bank account
    acknowledgement letter was signed by the TPA on behalf 24. In these circumstances,
    the firm should first provide the TPA with the requisite authority (such as a
    power of attorney) before the TPA will be able to sign the client bank account
    acknowledgement letter on the firm’s behalf. A firm should also ensure that the
    client bank account acknowledgement letter continues to be drafted on letter-headed
    paper belonging to CASS 25. A firm must ensure that each of its client bank accounts
    follows the naming conventions prescribed in the Glossary . This includes ensuring
    that all client bank accounts include the term ‘client’ in their title or an appropriate
    abbreviation in circumstances where this is permitted by acknowledgement letter
    should also be made consistently in either the singular or plural, as CASS CHAPTER
