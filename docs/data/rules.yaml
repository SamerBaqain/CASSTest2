    to belong to the client until the firm's right to realise that asset crystallises
    (that is, on the client's default). But under a "right to use arrangement", the
    client has transferred to the firm the legal title and associated rights to the
    asset, so that when the firm exercises its right to treat the asset as its own,
    the asset ceases to belong to the client and in effect becomes the firm's asset
    and is no longer in need of the full range of client asset protection. The firm
    may exercise its right to treat the asset as its own by, for example, clearly

    for client s'' assets when the firm is responsible for them. An essential part
    of that protection is the proper accounting and handling of client money The rules
    in 5.1 to 5.6 also give effect to the requirement in article 10.6 of the that
    all necessary measures should be taken to protect clients against the inability
    of an insurance intermediary to transfer premiums to an insurance undertaking
    or to transfer the proceeds of a claim or premium refund to the insured.


    (2) There are two particular approaches which firms can adopt which reflect options
    given in article 10.6. The first is to provide by law or contract for a transfer
    of risk from the insurance intermediary to the insurance undertaking ( 5.2 ).
    The second is that client money is strictly segregated by being transferred to
    client accounts that cannot be used to reimburse other creditors in the event
    of the firm''s insolvency ( 5.3 and 5.4 provide different means of achieving such
    segregation). 5.1.5A R permits a firm subject to certain conditions to treat money
    which it collects as agent of an insurance undertaking as client money ; the principle
    of strict segregation is, however, satisfied because such undertakings must agree
    to their interests being subordinated to the interests of the firm''s other clients
